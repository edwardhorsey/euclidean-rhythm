### Todo
- Sound of oscillators:
  - Gain staging for high frequencies
- new lambda
- nudge pattern L / R 
- import colours to sass
- reduce size of rhythms array for pattern graphics

### Future Plans
- Select a group of pitches to be played seqeuentially by your rhythm

### Bugs
- Not soo many ðŸ¤
