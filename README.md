### Todo
- Sound of oscillators:
  - Gain staging for high frequencies
- Draw function - add rhythms to graphicsRef as generated
- s3 permissions
- new pipeline
- mute
- nudge pattern L / R 

### Future Plans
- Select a group of pitches to be played seqeuentially by your rhythm

### Bugs
- Not soo many ðŸ¤
