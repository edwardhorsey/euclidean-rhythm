# Euclidean MIDI generator
## A sequencer for creating polyrhythms [WIP]
![WIPImage](https://i.imgur.com/8CTQ1Jp.png)

### Todo
- React Memo(?) for the SVG circle & protons to reduce rerendering
- Sound of oscillators:
  - Gain staging for high frequencies
- Draw function - add functionality for whenn seq running:
  - change duration of rhythm - reset sequencer to start at 1
- s3 permissions

### Future Plans 
- Extend bar lengths of 16 beat unit rhythms to have differentiating [euclidean style] bar lengths (beyond that of 1x and 2x)
- Select a group of pitches to be played seqeuentially by your rhythm

### Bugs
- Not soo many ðŸ¤
