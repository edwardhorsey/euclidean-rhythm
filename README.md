## A sequencer for creating Euclidean rhythms
![WIPImage](https://i.imgur.com/QS9Qohi.png)
_[A work in progress]_

### Todo
- Sound of oscillators:
  - Gain staging for high frequencies
  - More sounds, custom to each rhythm
- Nudge pattern L / R (?)
- Colours for muted mode

### Future Plans
- Asign a group of pitches to be looped through by your rhythm
- Add in Roland React 8 too (?)

### Bugs
- Not soo many ðŸ¤
